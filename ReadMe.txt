This is an openframeWorks sketch created for the IACD course at CMU.
In this sketch is made use of several preinstalled libraries such as ofxCV.
Next to this I would like to say special thanks to the creators of the
ofXSimpelSerial library and ofxFaceTracker.

In this program it is tracked by webcam whether one looks happy or angry.
When a Person is looking angry a LED burns and otherwise not. This was 
just for the purpose of getting libraries to work and showing that I could
communicate with the arduino.
